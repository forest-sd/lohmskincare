<div class="card"><h3>Building a Morning Skincare Routine That Actually Works</h3><p>The perfect morning routine doesn't need ten steps. It needs the right steps in the right order. Start with a gentle cleanser to remove overnight oil and product residue. Follow with a vitamin C serum — this is your daytime antioxidant shield against UV damage and pollution. Next, a lightweight moisturizer to lock in hydration. Finally, SPF 30 or higher, applied generously and evenly. That's four products, five minutes, and your skin is cleansed, protected, and nourished for the entire day. The key is consistency — a simple routine you actually follow beats a complex routine you abandon after a week.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Understanding Your Skin Barrier (And Why It Matters)</h3><p>Your skin barrier is the outermost layer of your skin — a protective shield made of lipids, ceramides, and dead skin cells that keeps moisture in and irritants out. When it's compromised by over-exfoliation, harsh cleansers, or environmental damage, you'll notice dryness, redness, sensitivity, and breakouts. Repairing a damaged barrier means simplifying your routine, avoiding active ingredients temporarily, and focusing on gentle, nourishing products rich in ceramides, squalane, and fatty acids. Think of it as letting your skin heal rather than trying to force results. A healthy barrier is the foundation of every other skincare goal.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>The Truth About Natural vs. Synthetic Ingredients</h3><p>Not everything natural is safe, and not everything synthetic is harmful. Poison ivy is natural. Hyaluronic acid is synthesized in labs. The real question isn't origin — it's efficacy and safety. At Lohm, we choose ingredients based on clinical evidence, safety profiles, and environmental impact, regardless of whether they come from a plant or a lab. What we avoid are ingredients with known health concerns: parabens linked to endocrine disruption, sulfates that strip skin oils, and synthetic fragrances that trigger sensitivities. Informed choices beat blanket rules every time.</p></div>
